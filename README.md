Comparison between different machine learning techniques by attempting to predict suicidal thoughts among youth in the US.

According to the World Health Organization, “Close to 800 000 people die by suicide every year. Furthermore, for each suicide, there are more than 20 suicide attempts.”¹ This study attempts to understand signs that might indicate suicidal thoughts among 15 to 19 years old adolescents. 

The dataset used was collected by the University of North Carolina for the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescents to Adults Health (Add Health). The first wave, which was collected in 1994, was used for analysis. 20745 high school students were asked various questions that resulted in a 2000 variable data set.
